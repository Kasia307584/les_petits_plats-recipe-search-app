### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Filter recipes using the search bar
- Filter recipes using select menus
- Search for items in the select menu
- Remove filters from recipes by closing filtered tags
- View the optimal layout for the website on desktop

### Links

- Live Site URL: [See the live page here](https://kasia307584.github.io/les_petits_plats-recipe-search-app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla JavaScript
- JavaScript modules
- HTML DOM API
- CSS3, HTML5 & BEM methodology

### What I learned

- use `JavaScript modules` (import, export)
- develop filtering and sorting functionality
- to create an array with data instead of `JSON` which allow to iterate through it without the need of fetching

### Continued development

- divide the code into more files (currently, only one JS file)
- move helper functions to a separate JS file (e.g., `normalise()`)
- apply the DRY principle by creating more efficient functions
- create a function that allows closing the dropdown after clicking anywhere on the page
- ensure the website is fully accessible
- add photos to the recipes
